    """
    A query represents a set of criteria to search nfldb's PostgreSQL
    database. Its primary feature is to provide a high-level API for
    searching NFL game, drive, play and player data very quickly.

    The basic workflow is to specify all of the search criteria that
    you want, and then use one of the `as_*` methods to actually
    perform the search and return results from the database.

    For example, to get all Patriots games as `nfldb.Game` objects from
    the 2012 regular season, we could do:

        #!python
        q = Query(db).game(season_year=2012, season_type='Regular', team='NE')
        for game in q.as_games():
            print game

    Other comparison operators like `<` or `>=` can also be used. To use
    them, append a suffix like `__lt` to the end of a field name. So to get
    all games with a home score greater than or equal to 50:

        #!python
        q = Query(db).game(home_score__ge=50)
        for game in q.as_games():
            print game

    Other suffixes are available: `__lt` for `<`, `__le` for `<=`,
    `__gt` for `>`, `__ge` for `>=`, `__ne` for `!=` and `__eq` for
    `==`. Although, the `__eq` suffix is used by default and is
    therefore never necessary to use.

    More criteria can be specified by chaining search criteria. For
    example, to get only plays as `nfldb.Play` objects where Tom Brady
    threw a touchdown pass:

        #!python
        q = Query(db).game(season_year=2012, season_type='Regular')
        q.player(full_name="Tom Brady").play(passing_tds=1)
        for play in q.as_plays():
            print play

    By default, all critera specified are combined conjunctively (i.e.,
    all criteria must be met for each result returned). However,
    sometimes you may want to specify disjunctive criteria (i.e., any
    of the criteria can be met for a result to be returned). To do this
    for a single field, simply use a list. For example, to get all
    Patriot games from the 2009 to 2013 seasons:

        #!python
        q = Query(db).game(season_type='Regular', team='NE')
        q.game(season_year=[2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013])
        for game in q.as_games():
            print game

    Disjunctions can also be applied to multiple fields by creating a
    `nfldb.Query` object with `nfldb.QueryOR`. For example, to find
    all games where either team had more than 50 points:

        #!python
        q = QueryOR(db).game(home_score__ge=50, away_score__ge=50)
        for game in q.as_games():
            print game

    Finally, multiple queries can be combined with `nfldb.Query.andalso`.
    For example, to restrict the last search to games in the 2012 regular
    season:

        #!python
        big_score = QueryOR(db).game(home_score__ge=50, away_score__ge=50)

        q = Query(db).game(season_year=2012, season_type='Regular')
        q.andalso(big_score)
        for game in q.as_games():
            print game

    This is only the beginning of what can be done. More examples that run
    the gamut can be found on
    [nfldb's wiki](https://github.com/BurntSushi/nfldb/wiki).

    def sort(self, exprs):

        Specify sorting criteria for the result set returned by
        using sort expressions. A sort expression is a tuple with
        two elements: a field to sort by and the order to use. The
        field should correspond to an attribute of the objects you're
        returning and the order should be `asc` for ascending (smallest
        to biggest) or `desc` for descending (biggest to smallest).

        For example, `('passing_yds', 'desc')` would sort plays by the
        number of passing yards in the play, with the biggest coming
        first.

        Remember that a sort field must be an attribute of the
        results being returned. For example, you can't sort plays by
        `home_score`, which is an attribute of a `nfldb.Game` object.
        If you require this behavior, you will need to do it in Python
        with its `sorted` built in function. (Or alternatively, use
        two separate queries if the result set is large.)

        You may provide multiple sort expressions. For example,
        `[('gsis_id', 'asc'), ('time', 'asc'), ('play_id', 'asc')]`
        would sort plays in the order in which they occurred within
        each game.

        `exprs` may also just be a string specifying a single
        field which defaults to a descending order. For example,
        `sort('passing_yds')` sorts plays by passing yards in
        descending order.

        If `exprs` is set to the empty list, then sorting will be
        disabled for this query.

        Note that sorting criteria can be combined with
        `nfldb.Query.limit` to limit results which can dramatically
        speed up larger searches. For example, to fetch the top 10
        passing plays in the 2012 season:

            #!python
            q = Query(db).game(season_year=2012, season_type='Regular')
            q.sort('passing_yds').limit(10)
            for p in q.as_plays():
                print p

        A more naive approach might be to fetch all plays and sort them
        with Python:

            #!python
            q = Query(db).game(season_year=2012, season_type='Regular')
            plays = q.as_plays()

            plays = sorted(plays, key=lambda p: p.passing_yds, reverse=True)
            for p in plays[:10]:
                print p

        But this is over **43 times slower** on my machine than using
        `nfldb.Query.sort` and `nfldb.Query.limit`. (The performance
        difference is due to making PostgreSQL perform the search and
        restricting the number of results returned to process.)
